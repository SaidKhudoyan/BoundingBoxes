# BoundingBoxes
A short program which detects edges and creates bounding boxes. For this we images and the corresponding masks.

The script will then get the images and masks as input and draws BoundingBoxes around each detected object. Afterwards the BoundingBoxes will be saved as json files, so they can later be used. The script will also create overlay images, where the actual object are displayed together with BoundingBoxes
